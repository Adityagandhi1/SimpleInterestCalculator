Simple Interest Calculator
A straightforward shell script designed to calculate simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. This project is a foundational exercise for migrating our team's code to Git and establishing open-source best practices.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
The core logic is contained within the simple-interest.sh file.

To run the calculator:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory.

Run the script from your terminal:
./simple-interest.sh
The script will prompt you to enter the Principal, Rate, and Time.
